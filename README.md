# php-mysql

After finishing the basecamp, this was my first project in the bootcamp.

I used a framework my tech coach provided to make a basic page to show a CV.

I used PHP and MySQL and followed the MVC practice to make this page.


# Installation
- composer install
- npm install
- create a MySQL database
- rename .env.example to .env and add your database credentials
