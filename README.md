Codegorilla lesson: Extend PHP framework with MySQL

This is just a basic PHP MVC framework to practice classes and learn coding when using Composer with autoload.
This repo is a copy of php-practice, extended with models, controllers and a MySQL library

# Installation
- composer install
- npm install
- create a MySQL database
- rename .env.example to .env and add your database credentials

Thats it ;-)
